Functionality Requirements Gathering;
The app offers an extensive range of products across various categories, including fashion, 
electronics, home goods, beauty, and more. Each product listing contains detailed 
information such as images, descriptions, prices, customer reviews, available sizes/colors, 
and delivery options.
Users have the ability to browse products using a search function located prominently at the 
top of the app, enabling them to easily find specific items they're looking for.
To assist users in their purchasing decisions, the app recommends products based on 
browsing history, wishlist items, and past purchases. Additionally, it showcases 'featured 
products' and 'trending items' on the home screen to highlight popular and exciting offers.
The app allows users to create personalized profiles upon signup, where they can manage 
their orders, track shipments, save favorite products, create wishlists, and receive tailored 
recommendations based on their preferences and browsing behavior.
For convenience, the app integrates a secure and seamless checkout process, supporting 
various payment methods and offering options for saved payment details and shipping 
addresses.
The right side of the app displays key product information including prices, discounts, product 
ratings, availability, and seller details, allowing users to quickly assess the essential details 
before making a purchase decision.
The app's primary focus is to provide a user-friendly, intuitive, and personalized e-commerce 
platform that caters to individual preferences, offering a seamless shopping experience on 
mobile devices.

USABILITY INSPECTION;
After we prepared our project’s layout and designs (both low fidelity and high fidelity) , we 
overviewed our project and that is what we had :
1. We found that we need to create a collection category in the favourite list page for our 
users to let them combine the same kind of products or different ones in a collection . 
In the next process of developing our projects , we will also add a sharing function 
which lets users share their collection in their profile or via other linked apps. 
(Favourite list page)
2. The next time , we think we can add a product recommendation part on the shopping 
cart page when the shopping cart is empty. This part will give recommendations for 
products that use the user's data from their recent visits , searches and visited 
categories. In this case , we can supply our users to find alternative things practically 
and make our app more dynamic and efficient. (Shopping cart page)
3. We also decided on a point that there should be a notification centre on the home 
page near the search button. (Home page) 
4. In the end , we offered an idea which includes showing the app’s name header on the 
login screen and registration part. (Login page)
USABILITY TESTING;
We have tested our user interface on 3 users , both our classmates from other groups , and 
in this section , we put their opinions and feedback. At first , we presented our design to them 
separately and then , we got opinions and feedback through their experiences . After that , 
we summarize their thoughts below :
Negative Feedbacks :
1. They gave a point where there is not a notification centre in the interface. They 
mentioned their experiences with shopping apps they used and declared this issue as 
an important thing to get feedback on the app. And we decided on the idea there 
should be a place as a notification centre. (working on it)
2. Another issue that they have noticed through their observations was there should be 
more customization on filters and sorting options in categories and these filtrations and 
sorters should vary on specified categories to help users find products efficiently. (will 
be expanded later)
